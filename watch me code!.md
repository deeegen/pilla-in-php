# See What I’m Building — Live

Hey!  

Want to see what I’m working on? New ideas, tests, and updates are happening all the time. You can watch it all happen, right now.  

Here’s the link to catch the latest progress:

If you drop by at the right time, you might even catch me live coding, designing, or fixing stuff as it happens.

Heads up: CodeSandbox sometimes changes project URLs. If this link breaks, just ask me for the newest one or look for an update here.  

Thanks for checking it out!
